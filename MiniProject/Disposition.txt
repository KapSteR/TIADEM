TIADEM Mini project - Random access compressive sensing
Disposition

Report stuff
 - Summary?
 - Introduction?
	- Purpose
	- Novelty?

 - Basic theory
 	- Sparsity/Sparsity in natural signals
 	- Basis
 		- FFT
 		- DCT
 		
 	- Sampling matrix
		- Random sensing
		- Determining optimal sensing probability

	- Conceptual idea of RACS

 - Presentation of implementation
 - Test setup
 - Results
 - Conclusion
 	- Something about discontinuities when vectorizing space causing harmonics (less sparsity)










Questions for Qi:
 - Dataset?
 	- Where do i find theirs
 	- Should i use another
 	- How much

 - What/how big is the scope of the project?
 	- Size of report
 	- Scope of implementation
 	- Amount of code to be handed in
