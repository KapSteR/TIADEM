\section{Introduction} % (fold)
\label{sec:introduction}
	In this report \emph{Random Access Compressed Sensing (RACS)}, as proposed by \cite{Fazel2011} is attempted implemented in MATLAB, with the aim of evaluating its use with other natural signals than those presented in in the article.
	Here data about sea surface temperature, gathered from satellites is used.

	This report has been produced as the result of a `Mini-project' in the course \emph{Advanced Embedded Sensor Networks (TIADEM)} at \emph{Aarhus University, Department of Engineering}.
	The goal of the project is to gain further understanding of the theory of \emph{Compressed Sensing (CS)}, by implementing it in MATLAB and applying it to real world data.

	The scope of this project is to simulate the random access protocol proposed by \cite{Fazel2011} and apply CS theory, to show how well (or not) the presented theories and models hold up.
	Some attention will also be given to how different specification parameters of a RACS system affect its performance. \fxnote{check if this holds} 
	A real world implementation of the protocol will not be considered, as it is beyond the scope of this report.
