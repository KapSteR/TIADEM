	\label{sec:matlab_implementation}

		Along with this report, the source code for the implementaion of RACS is handed in, in the \texttt{.rar}-archive called \texttt{MATLAB.rar}.

		It contains:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item All the scripts and functions mentioned in the text above.
			\item Some script pertaining the plotting of simulated data.
			\item The SST data used for this project.
		\end{itemize}

		\emph{Please note:} Several of the scripts rely on the SparseLab toolbox, available here: \cite{SparseLab:Online}

		Worth highlighting is the script \texttt{RACS\_Simulation.m}. It summarizes the functionality of many of the other scripts, and neatly explains the process.
